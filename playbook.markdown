# Introduction

### Digital Is Physical

The digital revolution, while transformative, carries a profound
environmental footprint. It is estimated that the Information and
Communications Technology (ICT) sector alone accounts for
approximately 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissionsâ€”a figure larger
than the entire aviation industry and equivalent to road freight. With
projections suggesting that this number may reach up to 14% by 2040,
the consequences for our climate and biodiversity cannot be overstated.

This playbook seeks to illuminate the often-overlooked fact that
the digital world is indeed physical: tethered to the environment in a
multitude of ways. Every byte of data, every online transaction, and every
digital innovation leaves a mark on our planet. It's crucial to recognize
that the servers, data centers, end-user devices, and vast infrastructure
enabling our digital experiences are grounded in physical reality,
consuming environmental resources and energy.

### Contribution To Global Warming

Given that manufacturing or production accounts for 57% of greenhouse
gas emissions related to digital and the internet, we need to take all
possible measures to lower manufacturing demand. This can be achieved
by reducing the number of connected objects and flat screens, as well as
increasing the lifespan of equipment.

On the other hand, usage or operation represents 43% of digital emissions.
To address this, it is important to build low-carbon and sustainable digital
services and products.
