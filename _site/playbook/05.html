  <h1>Measure the environmental impact of your business</h1>

  <p>Understanding the source of your business emissions is
important to prioritize the most effective pathway to reduce
emissions. It will also help you to realize the contribution of digital
technologies to the overall carbon footprint of your operations.

Since most emissions originate from your supply chain (scope 3),
measuring them can be challenging as you depend on suppliers
to provide this information and data points.

Nonetheless, as you cannot improve what you cannot measure,
your journey towards sustainability must commence here in order
to create a more impactful, deliberate, and effective action plan.
</p>
  <p>Connect with the right people: It could be your ESG team,
sustainable leaders internally, or external providers with,
ideally, some experience in digital emissions measurement
Quantify your company’s value chain (scope 1, 2 and 3) carbon
emissions and perform a cradle-to-grave lifecycle analysis on
your product

Include impacts from devices, networks, and data centers
across their life cycle (manufacturing, distribution, usage,
to end of life)

Choose the right metrics and make sure you can measure
them fairly quickly to begin assessing improvements
Identify measurement frequency and who’s leading the effort

Pinpoint opportunities for emission reduction. Consider the top-
line revenue opportunities (eg. customer acquisition, adoption of

greener products, improved performance and UX, etc.) and
bottom-line cost savings (lower hosting fees, streamlined
development, etc.) when presenting your findings to the team.

Prioritize opportunities for emission reduction and build
a roadmap accordingly

Repeat annually, or in line with your business development
strategy
</p>
  <p>Collective efforts to gauge and reduce ecological
footprints

Cross-departmental participation in green
initiatives
</p>
  <p>As a product leader, it's important to recognize that your
impact and influence can extend beyond the digital realm. As an
example, if shipping emissions are a big chunk of the emissions
profile of your e-commerce business, you could lower emissions
by reducing the return rate of your physical product (by helping
users buy the right product, at the right size, colour, specs, etc.)
and by partnering with sustainable, electric local shipping
companies.
In 2022, approximately 16.5% of items purchased online were
returned in the US. Imagine the impact you could make by
offering a better purchasing experience! Read more on how to
Influence your value chain and partners.
