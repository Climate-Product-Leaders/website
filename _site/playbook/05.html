  <h1>Prioritize climate initiatives</h1>

  <p>Your backlog holds great potential for engagement with 
your stakeholders and communicating what is important for the
product moving forward and why. Refining it with your team is a
great moment to incorporate and address climate considerations 
as part of the process. Once tickets are prioritized into a sprint, you
will have identified and mitigated some climate risks and impacts.
</p>
  <p>- Create user stories (US) specific to climate and sustainability
that will help to support your entire product (systemic impact
across features)

- Use tags to identify climate and sustainability-specific US

- Consider energy consumption and GHG emissions during
grooming and sprint preparation. Some features may be
‘oversized’, and others may be more energy-consuming or
complex than you thought.

- Ideate on early-stage solutions and compare their
environmental impact

- Assign an estimated environmental impact to user stories or
product increments, including both backend and frontend
impacts

- Prioritize climate and sustainability-specific user stories in your
sprint planning, just as you would prioritize bugs, security
tickets, technical debt, refactoring, etc.

- Consider a climate-focused sprint as a means of applying all 
the best practices discussed. Normalise your climate action 
by ensuring that the same discussions continue to take place 
on an ongoing basis.
</p>
  <p>- Enhanced user experience leading to improved
conversion rates and overall satisfaction

- Adoption of cleaner electricity sources 
for operations

- Established targets for reduced carbon and 
greenhouse gas emissions
</p>
  <p>When you Track your digital footprint; leveraging
data to explain and support the prioritization of climate features
that will help reduce your emissions will be easier.

We recommend that you keep the discussion about the impact
you are trying to achieve rather than the specific way to improve
performance and metrics. Empower and trust your team to know
what to do if you are clear about priorities and acceptable tradeoffs. Aim for improvement, not perfection. Making climate part of the prioritization process is a huge step forward!
