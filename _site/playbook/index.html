measuring them can be challenging as you depend on suppliers

      <div><p>Even though all business contexts are different, a set of 
key environmental metrics should help you drive positive impact.
These metrics are generally greenhouse gas emissions (starting
with carbon emissions), energy consumption, water consumption,
resource use and depletion, water/air/soil pollution, ecotoxicity,
biodiversity, etc. Some are more obvious than others, and you 
won’t track them all on day one.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider both absolute metrics (e.g. CO2e) and relative metrics
(CO2e per page, visit, user, employee, revenue generated, etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Factor different types of impact: greenhouse gas emissions 
(in g of CO2e or kg of CO2e), Energy consumption (in kWh),
Water consumption (in cl or l), depletion of natural resources,
etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measure data transfer parameters: page weight (in KB), number
of requests, and load time (in s). Keep in mind that it will not be
the absolute way to measure but it is a good starting point in
your journey.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Use the right tools for your context and your needs.

      <div><p>We recommend keeping things simple at the beginning. If
you don’t measure anything, go for a proxy (80% accuracy is
better than not tracking anything). Observing trends consistently
over time is more important than being 100% accurate, and will
support you to identify the next steps and keep moving forward.</p>

<p>Measuring your digital footprint once will be a major milestone
and should be celebrated. From there, you could set up a
dashboard and monitor environmental impact on an ongoing
basis to measure progress (or regress)</p>

<p>Figure out whether you have the resources internally 
to undertake an initial audit and ongoing measurement, 
or if you may need to outsource this phase</p>

<p>There are some great free tools that can help you to get started
and measure simple web pages, such as Ecograder or Beacon -
both powered by CO2.js. You can also get a Digital Ratings or
Score using Sustainable Web Design or eco Index - the latter is
available only in French.</p>

<p>Other tools offer specific measurements depending on 
your needs, such as CO2.js for websites, apps, and platforms,
Greenspector for user scenarios or web apps, Step CI for APIs, or
Cloud Carbon Footprint for cloud services</p>

<p>You can understand the impact of existing third parties 
with BuiltWith or Are my third parties green</p>

<p>We recommend that you go with tools designed with companies
like yours in mind that offer specialist features, such as fruggr.io,
Verdikt, or Greenframe if you’re ready to invest in 
a comprehensive solution</p>

<p>Make sure measurements include impacts from devices,
networks, and data centers across their life cycle
