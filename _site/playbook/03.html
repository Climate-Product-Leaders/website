  <h1>Track your digital footprint</h1>

  <p>Zooming in on digital emissions and impact is critical 
to building a coherent plan to start or accelerate your sustainable
journey. Whether you manage a website, a platform or an app, there
are different service providers, tools, and platforms to help you
measure your impact and build a compelling pathway to
sustainability.
</p>
  <p>- Choose the right metrics

Figure out whether you have the resources internally 
to undertake an initial audit and ongoing measurement, 
or if you may need to outsource this phase

There are some great free tools that can help you to get started
and measure simple web pages, such as Ecograder or Beacon -
both powered by CO2.js. You can also get a Digital Ratings or
Score using Sustainable Web Design or eco Index - the latter is
available only in French.

Other tools offer specific measurements depending on 
your needs, such as CO2.js for websites, apps, and platforms,
Greenspector for user scenarios or web apps, Step CI for APIs, or
Cloud Carbon Footprint for cloud services

You can understand the impact of existing third parties 
with BuiltWith or Are my third parties green

We recommend that you go with tools designed with companies
like yours in mind that offer specialist features, such as fruggr.io,
Verdikt, or Greenframe if you're ready to invest in 
a comprehensive solution

Make sure measurements include impacts from devices,
networks, and data centers across their life cycle
(manufacturing, distribution, usage, to end of life)
</p>
  <p>Collective efforts to gauge and reduce ecological
footprints

Cross-departmental participation in green
initiatives
</p>
  <p>As a product leader, it's important to recognize that your
impact and influence can extend beyond the digital realm. As an
example, if shipping emissions are a big chunk of the emissions
profile of your e-commerce business, you could lower emissions
by reducing the return rate of your physical product (by helping
users buy the right product, at the right size, colour, specs, etc.)
and by partnering with sustainable, electric local shipping
companies.
In 2022, approximately 16.5% of items purchased online were
returned in the US. Imagine the impact you could make by
offering a better purchasing experience! Read more on how to
Influence your value chain and partners.
